This is the source repository for the Tufts Robotics Club's 2015 "Smallbot"
entry to the Trinity Fire-Fighting robotics contest. The robot must navigate
a miniature, simulated house to locate and then extinguish a burning candle.

About the robot
---------------

We designed Smallbot to compete for the "Tiny Robot Award," which is given to
the smallest robot that successfully completes the challenge. The robot is
driven by three omnidirectional wheels, equally spaces around the base. Each
wheel is powered by a Hitec HS-1425CR continuous rotation servo. The robot has
a distance sensor and a flame sensor pointing in each of the four cardinal
directions, and a line sensor centered on the bottom. It uses derivative
control to navigate the maze. It has a top-mounted CO<sub>2</sub> canister,
actuated by a motor, to extinguish the candle.
